# LeetCode Solutions and DSA Guide ðŸš€  

## **About This Repository**  
This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, categorized into different topics such as Mathematics, SQL, Strings & Arrays, and more. Each solution includes Java and C# implementations.

## **Folder Structure**  

This repository is organized by topics, subtopics, and individual problem solutions. Each problem contains **Java and C# implementations** with explanations.  


### **How to Navigate?**  
- **Topics**: Organized at the top level (`Strings-and-Arrays/`, `SQL/`).  
- **Subtopics**: Inside each topic folder (e.g., `Sliding_Window/`, `Two_Pointer/`).  
- **Problem-Specific Folders**: Named after **LeetCode problem codes and titles** (`LC-567_Permutation-in-String/`).  
- **Solutions**: Each problem folder contains Java (`LC567.java`) and C# (`Program.cs`) implementations.
- **LeetCode Question Image**: Each problem folder includes an image (`LC567.png`) of the problem statement for quick reference.

This structure ensures **clarity, scalability, and easy access** to solutions. ðŸš€
